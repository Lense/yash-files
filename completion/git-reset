# Completion script for the "git-reset" command.
# Supports Git 1.7.7.

# Modified by Lense from r4166 commit
# Add support for resetting staged files
# Test case:
# $ git init
# $ touch file
# $ git add file
# $ git reset <complete>
# In r4166, "HEAD" would be completed.
# After this patch, "HEAD" and "file" are both completed.
